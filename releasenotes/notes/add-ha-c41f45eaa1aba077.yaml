features:
  - |
    This version adds support for using more than one nshield HSM in load
    sharing mode.  There is a new variable `nshield_hsms` that accepts
    a list of HSM IP addresses.  See `vars.yaml.sample` for an example.
    Note that HSM Pools are not supported at this time.
deprecations:
  - |
    Two variables have been deprecated: `thales_hsm_ip_address` and
    `thales_hsm_config_location`.  You should use the new `nshield_hsms` list
    to specify these values instead.  See `vars.yaml.sample` for an example.
